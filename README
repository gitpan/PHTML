"Perl Embedded HTML" Page Cache

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This module requires FastCGI or Apache/mod_perl.  If you are not using
one of these packages, investigate that first.

* Easier than HTML::Embperl

* Does not require a separate binary like eperl

Accepts page source code that looks like this:

 <body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#000000" vlink="#000000" >
 <center><h1><big>
 <: small_caps("Mondo Server") :>
 </big></h1></center>
 <p>

Perl source code is quoted between <: and :> symbols.  These quotes
are matched at the beginning/end of lines.  Your PHTML code is
rewritten into a single block, so you can declare lexical variables or
loops and continue them further down the page.

It's all very simple and easy.
